Quick Start Guide
=================

Download Django Project
-----------------------

First, you have to clone the project from bitbucket::

    $ git clone


Project Name
------------

This project is named |project_name|, so if you are using this
Boilerplate to create your own project, you'll have to change
the name in a few places:

 - |project_path| **folder** (your top project container)
 - |project_path|/|project_path| **folder**
 - virtual environment names: |project_path|
